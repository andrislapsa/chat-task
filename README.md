Install npm dependencies `npm i`

Then use `npm start` to launch dev server.

Or use `npm run build` to create a static version and serve it from `./build` directory with http-server.

Ensure you're also running the backend server (see https://github.com/andrislapsa/chat-task-be) on `ws://localhost:3030`
